# Flask-Flash
Flask API Framework to create CRUD APIs (and non-CRUD) with embedded API client.

To create a new API, you need to create the following files:
app/__init__.py
app/manage.py    
app/models.py
app/resources.py

Take a look at the example apps in the examples/ folder.
You can run the example apps like:

```
cd examples/<example>
./manage.py runserver
```
